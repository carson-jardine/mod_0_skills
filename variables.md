# Variables

``` ruby

food = "Mashed Potatoes"
is_delicious = true
food = "Pad Thai"
num2 = 4.0
num7 = 42.0

quotient = "#{num7 / num2}" #not sure if the syntax of this is correct but it was the only way I could make it run

songs = ["Yesterday", "Reason", "Rain on Me", "Hello"]

songs.shift

food.length
